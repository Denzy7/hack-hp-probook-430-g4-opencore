# bios
## VERSION
- Flash v1.23 dated 17th Aug 2018 (or 18th July 2018 on some machines) from [this link](https://ftp.hp.com/pub/softpaq/sp91001-91500/sp91342.exe). Recent bios versions refuse to boot and get stuck at [HID: Legacy shim 2](hid_legacy_shim.jpg). If you want to get the most recent version of bios, you could test bios versions between 1.25 up to 1.37 as i haven't tested these versions (and franky I WON'T ðŸ˜›)
